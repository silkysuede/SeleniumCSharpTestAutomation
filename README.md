# Test Suite in C# w/ Selenium
I built this project by following tutorials online. 

The purpose of this project is to show my ability to write automated tests in C#, as well as serve as a nice little intro for me into the world of automation testing. 

It uses NUnit for the testing framework and employs Selenium for browser emulation.

It includes end-to-end testing for various user flows on the tutorial creator's website. 

It tests things like logging in, creating listings in a UI, searching for listings, deleting listings- things like that.
