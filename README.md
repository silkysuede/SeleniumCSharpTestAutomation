# SeleniumCSharpTestAutomation
I built this project by following tutorials online. The purpose of the project is to show my ability to write automated tests in Selenium and C#, as well as serve as a nice little intro for me into the world of automation testing. It uses NUnit for the testing framework and employs Selenium for the browser emulation.
